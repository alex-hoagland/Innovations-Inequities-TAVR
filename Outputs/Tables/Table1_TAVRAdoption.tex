        \item \textit{Table Notes}: Each cell represents the fraction of the surgical type performed by the type of medical professional in a given year. Sample is limited to all aortic valve replacement surgeries (TAVR/SAVR) procedures. Totals do not add up to 100\% because some procedures are performed by a team comprised of both CT surgeons and IV cardiologists, and others are performed by physicians with other listed specialties (e.g., internal medicine). Cardiothoracic surgeons are those whose primary specialty is listed as “cardiac surgery”, “thoracic surgery”, or “general surgery”; interventional cardiologists are those whose primary specialty is listed as “interventional cardiology”, “cardiology”, or “cardiovascular disease”.
