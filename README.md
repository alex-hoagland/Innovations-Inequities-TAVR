# Innovations and Inequities in Access to Medical Services
Alex Hoagland, University of Toronto 

Working Paper, March 2023 

This repository includes the relevant code to replicate the outputs presented in the working paper "[Innovations and Inequities in Access to Medical Services](https://alex-hoagland.github.io/files/Hoagland_InnovationsInequities_TAVR.pdf)." 

## Data
Data used in this project comes from the CMS Research Data Assistance Center (ResDAC) [files](https://resdac.org/cms-data/files), including the 100% inpatient claims (FFS) data, the full base file for beneficiaries and providers, and the 20% outpatient FFS files from 2010 to 2017. Files contain demographic information and physician specialization information as well as fee-for-service (FFS) claims submitted by providers for reimbursement. Data are not publicly available and cannot be shared but can be requested through CMS.

## Code
Use the file TAVR_Master.do to run all relevant code. Directories should be updated to fit on your local machine or server.
